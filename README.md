# map_reducer.py

This script implements a basic map-reduce functionality.
The main purpose of this script is to demonstrate how the map-reduce paradigm can be implemented in Python.
The script takes a list of input data and applies a map function to each element of the list. The map function transforms each element into a key-value pair.
After the map phase, the script performs a reduce operation on the key-value pairs. The reduce function aggregates the values associated with each key.
The input data and the map and reduce functions are defined in the script.

Usage:
    python map_reducer.py

# Study application

The map-reduce paradigm is a powerful tool for processing large datasets in a distributed environment. It allows for parallel processing of data by dividing the data into smaller chunks, processing each chunk independently, and then combining the results. In this case, we are reading the data from a list and processing it in a single-threaded environment. However, the same principles can be applied to distributed systems to process data in parallel. Below, there is an abstration of the map-reduce paradigm in Python. Our application is a simple example of how the map-reduce paradigm can be implemented in Python. The script defines a list of input data and two functions: a map function and a reduce function. The map function takes an element of the input data and transforms it into a key-value pair. The reduce function takes a key and a list of values associated with that key and aggregates the values. The script then applies the map function to each element of the input data, collects the key-value pairs, and applies the reduce function to aggregate the values for each key. Finally, the script prints the results of the reduce operation. This example demonstrates the basic principles of the map-reduce paradigm and how it can be implemented in Python.

# Define the input data
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Define the map function

    """
    Maps an element to a key-value pair.

    Args:
